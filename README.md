# Airbnb new user bookings competition


In this Airbnb Kaggle challenge, we had to build ML prediction pipeline predicting the country to which a new user will make his/her  first booking. Predicting the region of booking will help provide better content to the users with regard to their choice of destination, decrease the average time to first booking, and better forecast demand, thus benefitting both the customers and Airbnb.

## Implementation
Applied feature engineering techniques such as oversampling methods, polynomial feature transformation. Trained classifiers such as xgboost, adaboost; along with ensembling (stacking). Used Nested cross validation and Bayesian optimization for hyper-parameter tuning.
